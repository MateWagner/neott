# NeoTT

> It's a Raspberry Pi and Python-based IoT project for a seamless IoT experience.
> Imagine the scenario when someone arrives at your house and wants to turn on or off your smart light. They need to download an application to gain access and use the light. That's why in this project I'm mixing MQTT connectivity with a locally sourced web interface which stays sync between all the clients on every platform allow to integrate and automate via MQTT in local environment.
> The project connects four technologies: MQTT client, Web Server, socketIO, Adafruit Neopixel, and some basic light shows at an early stage of development.
